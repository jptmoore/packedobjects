@section What is libpackedobjects?
@cindex What is libpackedobjects

libpackedobjects is a C library which can be used to efficiently compress an XML DOM by using the information provided by a corresponding XML Schema. The tool is designed for writing network protocols which strive to minimise the amount of data communicated. This is similar to something like @uref{http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/, Protocol Buffers} but using XML. As well as encode efficiently the tool validates all data according to the schema.

libpackedobjects is based on libxml2 and therefore should run on any system that libxml2 runs on.

@section Use case
libpackedobjects is currently being incorporated into an XML messaging framework for specific use on wireless networks.
@cindex Use case

@section Limitations
@cindex Limitations

libpackedobjects is not a general purpose document compression tool. It is intended to be used in an application that generates XML that you wish to communicate over a network. As such it provides a simple DOM-based API for encoding and decoding structured data. The compression technique used is based on applying knowledge of the data types specified in a schema to provide better performance over statistical compression techniques. Therefore, you must write a valid schema for your data. However, the schema serves the purpose of formalising the network protocol and provides validation. Thus we think having a schema is a good thing!
